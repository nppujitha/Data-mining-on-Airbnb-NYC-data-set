# Data-mining-on-Airbnb-NYC-data-set
 The project is all about analysis of NYC Airbnb dataset and the models we have built for the prediction on dataset. We have chosen the data set "kaggle" enhanced by Airbnb.  We have done comprehensive analysis on the dataset, explored most of the variables, constraints and collected all attributes that are reliable and useful. Further we selected the model, interpreted the prediction task and the evaluation method. While we are building the process of model, we had some challenges and limitations to identify best fit model. At the end we have got a best model for the prediction, analyzing tasks. The process also consists of hypothesis, objective of data set, baseline description, constraints, model selection, data mining task selection, implementation of model, results reasoning, description and tuning of parameters
